# All the OpenSCAD files i made

Its as simple as the title says.
This is the place where i collect my OpenSCAD files, with docs, links to "marketplaces" where i uploaded them, build tasks, and releases whenever i feel like i wanna make one.

I use BSOL2, so you need to either use the nix flake in this repo to setup this up automatically via the DevShell, or do it yourself.
